What a amazing library!!!!! for driving lcd because when you use a compass and imu6050 you need fast response of the lcd and i reach 500ms with no flicker digit .the strategy was to load the background in the setup than update the compass and imu values in the loop.
Next step was to switch background to have different view. So a create a function to switch at the beginning of the loop to swap the view on the screen.
